So I should have the following:
    1. an experiment script
    2. environments
    3. algorithms 
    4. policies (??)
    5. utilities

There are some design choices that must be made, such as:
    terminal states (vs. decaying reward)
    etc...


TODO:
    make it into a proper package (so I can just import everything and be good to go!)

P: (S,A,S) or (S,A,S+1)
R: (S,A)
pi: (S,A)
gamma: scalar
Q(S,A)
