TODO:
    reorganize MAIN CODE BASE:
        top-level class
        more general environments, etc.
        clean interfaces
        clean-up scruff
    launchers / exp_logging:
        use a database (?)
        make launchers have debug version 
            I should use the same cmd_line args for all of my exp scripts:
                saving, printing, debugging, testing, ...?
                    (build in analysis, as well???)
                    log github commits and stuff...? (that could go in the launcher)
    
    launcher should take:
        info about where to save stuff
        info about what system is being used (clusters, laptop, mila, etc.)
        exp_setting (debug / etc...)
