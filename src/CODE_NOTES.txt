GOD DAMN!
It looks like the environment uses std_dev, but the agent uses precision
    ...and therefor using the agent/env reward would lead to some interesting bugs...



It's getting hard to keep track of all the attributes and we're not respecting the objects' interfaces.
    Maybe we should have a top-level "experiment" object that takes an agent, environment (and settings / hparams) and runs them
    The query functions can be attributes of the agent or the top-level environment.


WOW this code is going to shit.
I'm wondering if I shouldn't just strip out a few key components and go from there...

I really hate having to pass things around... 
Mostly, I just want my functions to return everything into the global scope...
