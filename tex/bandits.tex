\title{Optimal close-arm regret for bandits with query cost is at least $O(n^{2/3})$ }
\maketitle

For a bandit with horizon $n$ and a strategy that queries $q$ times. If the arms are close, the main contributors to the regret are query cost and best arm misidentification. The query cost will be $c*q$. $q$ queries can distinguish arms that are about $1/\sqrt{q}$ apart. Thus the regret due to misidentifying the best arm will be

$$
\frac{ d n}{\sqrt{q}}
$$

Together we get 

$$
r = cq + \frac{ d n}{\sqrt{q}}
$$

Taking the derivative and solving for the optima we get 

\begin{align}
\frac{dr}{dq} = 0 = c - \frac{d n}{2 q^{\nicefrac{3}{2}} } 
\\c = \frac{d n}{2 q^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}} 
\\q^{\nicefrac{3}{2}} = \frac{d n}{2 c} 
\\ q = (\frac{d n}{2 c})^{\nicefrac{2}{3} }
\end{align}

Thus, the optimal regret for close-arms is at least $O(\frac{n}{c})^{2/3}$. Its a bit confusing that $c$ is in the denominator.
